***CURRENTLY NOT WORKING***
Implementing drag and drop for the pegs now. I would have a branch available with the buttons, but there was a bug with my method and it was only
meant to be a temporary solution anyway, so I'm not even going to bother fixing it.


Download the whole folder and open index.html in your browser and start playing!

About the game:
The board will generate a random combination of the 6 colors at the bottom of the screen and it is your job to crack it.

Make your guess and if you don't get right, you will be given a hint for your next guess. A red hint peg indicates that your code has a correct color 
in the correct position. The white hint peg indicates that you got a color right, but not the right position. The order of the hint pegs does not
correspond to any position in your code. It is your job to figure out which pegs the hints are for. Crack the code in less than 10 guesses and you win!

Left to do:
I'd like to pretty up the styling a bit and make the hints actually show as pegs.
