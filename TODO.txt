TODO List

Functional:
- Implement game as class (maybe, not really necessary)
- Do not allow interaction after game finished except to reload board
- Save and load gamestates
- Implement better alert system
- Allow users to place pegs in any position for current guess (drag and drop)
- Add restart button
- make n x m size board, render dynamically (probably will need class/object)

UI:
- Reveal code to break in place of black pegs at the top (win and lose?)
- Style pegs to look 3d
- Add original hint display
- Clean up control panel resizing
- Display current guess (Show on board somehow?)
- Pick better font for title
- Better background?
